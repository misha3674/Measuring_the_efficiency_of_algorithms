About program
The program comparison_algorithm.exe is created for comparison of such algorithms as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO),  simulated annealing.
The program allows to compare algorithms according to the following criteria:
•	Effectiveness
•	Speed
•	repetition (how stable algorithm is).
For the research of algorithms multi-objective optimization problem was chosen.
Multi-objective optimization (also known as multi-objective programming, vector optimization, multicriteria optimization,
multiattribute optimization or Pareto optimization) is an area of multiple criteria decision making,
that is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously [Wiki].
